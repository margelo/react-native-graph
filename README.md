## About

**react-native-graph** is a Line Graph implementation based on the high performance 2D graphics rendering engine "Skia". It's used in the [Pink Panda Wallet app](https://pinkpanda.io) to power thousands of token graphs every day.

* 🏎️ Faster and smoother than react-native-svg graphs
* ⚡️ Native path interpolation in Skia
* 🐎 Up to 120 FPS animations
* 📈 Cubic bezier rendering for smoother edges
* 👍 Smooth pan/scrubbing gesture
* 💰 Made for crypto apps and Wallets
* ❌ Does not block navigation, press or scroll animations

## Installation

<pre>
yarn add <a href="https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated">react-native-reanimated</a>
yarn add <a href="https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler">react-native-gesture-handler</a>
yarn add <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/react-native-skia">@shopify/react-native-skia</a>
yarn add <b>react-native-graph</b>
</pre>

## Usage

```jsx
function App() {
  const priceHistory = usePriceHistory('ethereum')

  return <LineGraph points={priceHistory} color="#4484B2" />
}
```

## Configuration

### `animated`

<img src="./img/change.gif" align="right" height="250" />

Whether to animate between data changes.

Animations are ran using the [Skia animation system](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-skia/docs/animations/animations) and are fully natively interpolated to ensure best possible performance.

If `animated` is `false`, a light-weight implementation of the graph renderer will be used, which is optimal for displaying a lot of graphs in large lists.

Example:

```jsx
<LineGraph
  points={priceHistory}
  animated={true}
  color="#4484B2"
/>
```

---

### `enablePanGesture`

<img src="./img/pan.gif" align="right" height="250" />

Whether to enable the pan gesture.

>  Requires `animated` to be `true`.

There are three events fired when the user interacts with the graph:

1. `onGestureStart`: Fired once the user presses and holds down on the graph. The pan gesture _activates_.
2. `onPointSelected`: Fired for each point the user pans through. You can use this event to update labels or highlight selection in the graph.
3. `onGestureEnd`: Fired once the user releases his finger and the pan gesture _deactivates_.

Example:

```jsx
<LineGraph
  points={priceHistory}
  animated={true}
  color="#4484B2"
  enablePanGesture={true}
  onGestureStart={() => hapticFeedback('impactLight')}
  onPointSelected={(p) => updatePriceTitle(p)}
  onGestureEnd={() => resetPriceTitle()}
/>
```

---

### `TopAxisLabel` / `BottomAxisLabel`

<img src="./img/label.png" align="right" height="250" />

Used to render labels above or below the Graph.

>  Requires `animated` to be `true`.

Usually this is used to render the maximum and minimum values of the Graph. You can get the maximum and minimum values from your graph points array, and smoothly animate the labels on the X axis accordingly.

Example:

```jsx
<LineGraph
  points={priceHistory}
  animated={true}
  color="#4484B2"
  TopAxisLabel={() => <AxisLabel x={max.x} value={max.value} />}
  BottomAxisLabel={() => <AxisLabel x={min.x} value={min.value} />}
/>
```

---

### `selectionDotShadowColor`

<img src="./img/selection-dot.jpeg" align="right" height="250" />

The color of the selection dot.

>  Requires `animated` and `enablePanGesture` to be `true`.

Example:

```jsx
<LineGraph
  points={priceHistory}
  animated={true}
  color="#4484B2"
  enablePanGesture={true}
  selectionDotShadowColor="#333333"
/>
```
